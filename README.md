## General info
Created a small implementation to generate the captions for a video file, convert those captions into different languages and once again burn-in them with the actual video in a serverless way using AWS services. Through this solution you can generate videos with different language subtitles. Consider it as a POC as lot many features can be added both for enhancing the functionality as well as smoothen the overall work flow.
